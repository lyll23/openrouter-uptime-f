"""Decide whether a poll is due.

The collector is deliberately over-scheduled. GitHub's cron drops runs rather
than merely delaying them -- that is why coverage sat at 43% of the nominal
hourly rate -- so the workflow fires several times an hour and relies on this
guard to turn the surplus attempts into no-ops. The same guard lets a second
collector (Railway) run on a tighter cadence without the two of them
double-polling: whoever arrives first writes, the other sees a fresh timestamp
and stands down.

Freshness is read from status/latest.json, which poll.py rewrites on every
successful run. A missing or unparseable file means "poll" -- on a cold start
we would rather take an extra sample than none.

Exit code is always 0. The decision is communicated on stdout and, under
GitHub Actions, through the `poll` step output.
